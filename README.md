# Jenkins Bash Scripts

The Jenkins bash scripts support Jenkins Items with different tasks.

These scripts are used internally only at the time of writing.
If you would like to use the scripts with your Jenkins automation server or if you have any questions,
please contact the [EEROS Team](http://eeros.org/eeros-team/).
